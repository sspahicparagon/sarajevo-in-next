During 1994, small rails were installed through the tunnel on which small carts could travel. Also in 1994, the Republika Srpska army found out about the tunnel, so Ratko Mladić contacted the UN-held airport and demanded that the tunnel be demolished and closed. Then the VRS tried by digging another tunnel and diverting the Željeznica river to submerge the tunnel and thus disable it, but their intention failed.\nThe service in the Memorial Complex \"Tunnel Spasa\" is extremely professional and informative.
